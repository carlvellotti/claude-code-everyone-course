## 1.1: Course Introduction

- **Time to Complete:** 10 minutes

> **Start this module in Claude Code:** Run `/start-1-1` to kick off the interactive experience.

## ▶️ Reminder on How to Get Started

⚠️ **If you haven't cloned the repository yet:** Go back to [Module 0.2: Start Claude Code & Clone the Course](/getting-started/start-and-clone) first. You'll need the course files on your computer to continue.

**There are two ways to launch this course in Claude Code:**

### Option One: Find it in the File Explorer

Navigate to your Documents folder and find the `cc4e-course` folder. Then right-click and select "New Terminal at Folder"

It will look something like this:

![Opening folder from file explorer](/images/folder-location.png)

Then type `claude` and hit Enter

### Option Two: Open it from the Terminal

Type these commands into your terminal:
```bash
cd ~/Documents/cc4e-course
claude
```

This navigates to your course folder and opens Claude Code directly inside it.

**Either way, you end up at the same place. Then, to start this module:**

> **Start this module in Claude Code:** Run `/start-1-1` to kick off the interactive experience.

This is how you will start every module!

## How This Course Works

- **Learning by doing** - not watching videos
- **Claude teaches you directly** in the terminal
- **Reference guides** (what you're reading) provide deeper context
- Every lesson has a reference page on ccforeveryone.com

### Interactive Lessons

Each lesson starts with a slash command:
- `/start-1-1`, `/start-1-2`, etc.

Claude guides you step-by-step through hands-on exercises. You actually do the work, not just read about it.

### Reference Guides

These pages provide:
- Deeper explanations of concepts
- Quick reference for commands and patterns
- Additional resources and links
- Troubleshooting help
