## 1.2: File Exploration & Visual Workspace

- **Time to Complete:** 15 minutes

> **Interactive lesson:** Run `/start-1-2` in Claude Code

## The Dual-Pane Workflow

**Problem:** Terminal is great for talking to Claude, but you can't see your files.

**Solution:** Use a visual editor alongside Claude Code.

| Pane | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Left side** | File explorer (see everything) |
| **Bottom** | Claude Code terminal (work with everything) |

## Choose Your Tool

### Nimbalyst (Recommended)

**Best for:** Non-technical Claude Code users who want the smoothest experience

![Nimbalyst - Visual workspace for Claude Code](/images/nimbalyst-hero.webp)

[Nimbalyst](https://nimbalyst.com?ref=carlvellotti&utm_source=carlvellotti&utm_medium=ccforeveryone&utm_campaign=partner) is a free, purpose-built workspace for Claude Code with:

- **WYSIWYG markdown editing** - See formatted text, not raw markdown syntax
- **File diffs** - See exactly what Claude changed when editing files

**Best for:** Users who want a code editor or plan to do Module 2's vibe coding

[Cursor](https://cursor.com) is a free code editor that works alongside Claude Code:

- Shows your files visually while you work with Claude
- Has its own AI features (you don't need them - Claude Code is better)
- Great for Module 2 when you build a real app
- VS Code works too if you prefer it

## Exploring Unfamiliar File Structures

Once Claude Code is running, you can ask:

```
Show me the file structure
```

```
Summarize the contents of the docs/ folder
```

```
What files are in this project?
```

Claude can map out any folder of documents for you.

## Markdown Files

- `.md` extension = Markdown format
- Common standard for documents - LLMs love it
- **Preview mode:** `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+V` shows formatted view (in Cursor)
- **Nimbalyst:** Shows formatted by default

## Real-World Applications

- **Inherit a project from a coworker** - Claude maps it out
- **Client sends messy brand assets** - get oriented in minutes
- **Downloads folder chaos** - Claude helps clean up
- **Starting a new job** - understand the team's shared drive
- **Any unfamiliar file structure**
