## 0.2: Download & Start

- **Time to Complete:** 5 minutes
- **Prerequisites:** Claude Code installed ([0.1](/getting-started/installation))

## Download the Course Materials

### Option 1: One-Line Command (Recommended)

**Mac/Linux:** Run this in your terminal:
```bash
cd ~/Documents && \
curl -L https://github.com/carlvellotti/claude-code-everyone-course/releases/download/v2.0.0/complete-course.zip -o cc4e-course.zip && \
unzip cc4e-course.zip && \
cd cc4e-course && \
claude "/start-1-1"
```

**Windows:** Download the zip from the link below, extract to Documents, then follow Option 2 or 3.

### Option 2: Let Claude Do It

This demonstrates Claude Code's core principle: describe what you want, Claude handles implementation.

1. Open terminal, type `claude` to start Claude Code
2. Tell Claude: "Download the course materials from https://github.com/carlvellotti/claude-code-everyone-course/releases/download/v2.0.0/complete-course.zip and extract it to a folder called cc4e-course in my Documents folder"
3. Exit and navigate: `exit`, then `cd ~/Documents/cc4e-course && claude`

### Option 3: Download Button

<a href="https://github.com/carlvellotti/claude-code-everyone-course/releases/download/v2.0.0/complete-course.zip" download style={{ display: 'inline-block', padding: '12px 24px', backgroundColor: '#1DD3B0', color: '#1C1C1C', fontWeight: 'bold', borderRadius: '8px', textDecoration: 'none', marginBottom: '16px' }}>
  Download Course Materials
</a>

1. Click the button above to download `complete-course.zip`
2. Extract the zip to your Documents folder
3. Follow the instructions below to open Claude Code from the course folder

## Open Claude Code from the Course Folder

If you used Option 1, this happens automatically.

If you used Option 2 or 3, you need to open a terminal in the course folder:

### Find it in the File Explorer

Navigate to your Documents folder and find the `cc4e-course` folder. Then right-click and select "New Terminal at Folder"

It will look something like this:

![Opening folder from file explorer](/images/folder-location.png)

Then type `claude` and hit Enter

### Or Open it from the Terminal

Type these commands into your terminal:
```bash
cd ~/Documents/cc4e-course
claude
```

This navigates to your course folder and opens Claude Code directly inside it.

> **Important:** Claude only sees files in the folder where you launch it. Always start Claude Code from the course folder.

## Start Your First Lesson

Once Claude Code is running from the course folder:

```
/start-1-1
```

Claude will begin teaching you interactively. Follow along and respond when prompted.

## Common Questions

### "Can I change the download location?"
Yes, just remember the path for the `cd` command.

### "What if the download fails?"
Try manual download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/carlvellotti/claude-code-everyone-course/releases/tag/v2.0.0).

### "Can I pause and come back later?"
Yes! Use `/resume` to pick up where you left off, or just run the lesson's `/start` command again.
