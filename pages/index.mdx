# Claude Code for Everyone

## Learn Claude Code IN Claude Code 😈

This course is taught entirely inside Claude Code itself.

- Install Claude Code, download the course materials, then type `/start-1-1`
- Claude guides you through each lesson interactively
- You learn by doing real work with real files

## What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is an AI assistant that works directly on your computer. It's not a chatbot - it's AI integrated into your actual workflow:

- **Reads and writes files** directly on your computer
- **Runs 10 instances in parallel** to process 10 files simultaneously
- **Remembers context** about your projects across every session
- **Analyzes images** you paste - screenshots, charts, mockups
- **Creates custom AI advisors** with different perspectives

The only command you need to know: `claude`

## Who This Course Is For

**Non-technical people** who want to use AI effectively for real work.

- No coding experience required
- No terminal experience required
- Just curiosity and a willingness to try something new

If you can have a conversation, you can use Claude Code.

## What You'll Learn

### Module 1: Fundamentals (~3 hours)

- **Visual workspace:** Set up a split-screen workflow to see files as Claude works
- **Parallel agents:** Launch multiple Claude instances to process files simultaneously
- **Custom sub-agents:** Create permanent AI advisors with different perspectives
- **Project memory:** Use CLAUDE.md so Claude remembers your project context
- **Commands & shortcuts:** Slash commands, keyboard shortcuts, power user features

### Module 2: Vibe Coding (Coming Soon)
