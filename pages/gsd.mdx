# GSD: Advanced Vibe Coding

![GSD Framework - Advanced Vibe Coding with Claude Code](/images/og-gsd-framework.png)

## Get Started

1. **Download the lesson folder:** [DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/carlvellotti/claude-code-everyone-course/releases/download/gsd-framework-v1.0/gsd-framework.zip)
2. **Open terminal in that folder**
3. **Run `claude` then type `/start-3-1`**

> **Prerequisites:** You should be comfortable with basic Claude Code usage (vibecoding). If not, complete [Module 2: Vibe Coding](/vibe-coding) first.

## GSD Framework: Spec-Driven Development

### What This Is

An interactive lesson teaching the **GSD (Get Shit Done)** framework - a production-grade workflow for building complex projects with Claude Code. You'll build a real Expense Splitter app while learning how to prevent context rot, use fresh subagent contexts, and create atomic, verifiable builds.

**Source:** [GSD by Lex Christopherson](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done)

### The Problem GSD Solves

Ever had Claude start strong then get worse as the session goes on? Like it's rushing, cutting corners, forgetting things you told it earlier?

That's **context rot**. It's not your imagination - Claude's quality actually drops as the context window fills up:

- **0-30% context:** Peak quality. Thorough, comprehensive, remembers everything.
- **50%+:** Starts rushing. "I'll be more concise." Cuts corners.
- **70%+:** Hallucinations. Forgotten requirements. Drift.

Basic vibecoding works for simple stuff, but it doesn't scale. Complex projects fall apart halfway through.

### How GSD Solves It

GSD uses **fresh subagent contexts**. Instead of one long session that gradually degrades, GSD spawns fresh Claude instances for each task. Each subagent gets a clean 200,000 token context window.

Task 50 has the *same quality* as Task 1. No degradation.

Meanwhile, your main session stays at 30-40% context while agents do the heavy lifting.

### The GSD Workflow

Four commands, one workflow:

| Step | Command | What It Does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| 1 | `/gsd:new-project` | Interview → Research → Requirements → Roadmap |
| 2 | `/gsd:plan-phase N` | Break phase into atomic task plans |
| 3 | `/gsd:execute-phase N` | Fresh agents build, verify, commit |
| 4 | `/gsd:verify-work N` | Goal-backward QA walkthrough |

Each step builds on the previous. Requirements trace to phases. Phases trace to plans. Plans trace to commits. Everything is connected and verifiable.

### Time Expectations

**This is important.** GSD does real work, which takes real time.

| Command | Time |
|---------|------|
| `/gsd:new-project` | 10-15 minutes |
| `/gsd:plan-phase` | 5-10 minutes |
| `/gsd:execute-phase` | 10-15 minutes |
| `/gsd:verify-work` | 3-5 minutes |

**Full lesson time: 45-60 minutes**, about 30 minutes of which is GSD working while you wait.

That's intentional. That's how you build quality software. Grab a coffee during the long steps.

### What You'll Learn

- **Context engineering** - Fresh contexts beat one degrading session
- **Aggressive atomicity** - Small plans, each fits in ~50% context
- **Plans are prompts** - PLAN.md files ARE the executable instructions
- **Wave-based parallelism** - Independent work runs in parallel
- **State persistence** - Resume anytime with STATE.md
- **Goal-backward verification** - Check what must be TRUE, not what tasks were done


### The Five Lessons

This module has 5 interactive lessons. You can run them in sequence, or jump to the section you want to learn about.


#### Lesson 3.1: What is GSD?

**Command:** `/start-3-1`

**What You'll Learn:**
- The context rot problem and why it happens
- How fresh subagent contexts solve it
- Installing GSD (`npx get-shit-done-cc`)
- The full workflow sequence
- What to expect from `/gsd:new-project`

**Key Concept:** GSD spawns fresh Claude instances for each task. Each gets a clean 200k context. Your main session stays clean while agents do heavy lifting.

**Time:** ~10 minutes (interactive, no waiting)


#### Lesson 3.2: Start a Project

**Command:** `/start-3-2`

**What You'll Do:**
- Run `/gsd:new-project` for the first time
- Answer GSD's interview questions
- Watch research agents investigate best practices
- Tour the `.planning/` folder that gets created

**Files Created:**
- `PROJECT.md` - Vision and constraints
- `REQUIREMENTS.md` - Features with traceable IDs
- `ROADMAP.md` - Phases with success criteria
- `STATE.md` - Persistent memory across sessions

**Key Concept:** GSD interviews you, spawns parallel research agents, and creates a complete spec. Your context stays clean while agents do the research.

**Time:** ~15 minutes (10-15 minutes is GSD working)


#### Lesson 3.3: Plan the Build

**Command:** `/start-3-3`

**What You'll Do:**
- Run `/gsd:plan-phase 1`
- Watch GSD create atomic task plans
- Understand the XML plan structure
- Learn wave-based parallelism

**Key Concepts:**

**Aggressive atomicity:** Each plan is 2-3 tasks, designed to fit in ~50% of a fresh context window. No single task is big enough to degrade quality.

**Plans are prompts:** The PLAN.md file isn't a document that becomes a prompt. It IS the executable instruction. Subagents read it directly.

**Waves:** Independent tasks run in parallel. Dependent tasks wait. Wave 1 might run three plans simultaneously. Wave 2 waits for Wave 1, then runs.

**Time:** ~10 minutes (5-10 minutes is GSD working)


#### Lesson 3.4: Execute

**Command:** `/start-3-4`

**What You'll Do:**
- Run `/gsd:execute-phase 1`
- Watch fresh agents build your app
- See atomic commits in git history
- Run your app and see what got built

**Key Concepts:**

**Fresh contexts:** Each agent gets a full 200k context. No degradation from first task to last.

**Atomic commits:** Each task gets its own commit. Git bisect works. You can revert individual tasks without losing other work.

**Phase 1 is foundation:** You'll have a working app, but it's Phase 1 only. Full app needs Phases 2 and 3.

**Time:** ~15 minutes (10-15 minutes is agents building)


#### Lesson 3.5: Verify & Beyond

**Command:** `/start-3-5`

**What You'll Do:**
- Run `/gsd:verify-work 1`
- Walk through interactive QA testing
- Learn about `/gsd:quick` for small changes
- Understand when to use GSD vs plain Claude Code

**Key Concepts:**

**Goal-backward verification:** Instead of "what tasks did we do?" GSD asks "what must be TRUE for this to work?" You test observable behaviors, not implementation details.

**Quick mode:** `/gsd:quick "Add dark mode"` - same fresh agent guarantees, skips heavy planning. Use for tweaks.

**When to use GSD:**
- ✅ Complex projects (multiple components, real logic)
- ✅ Multi-session work
- ✅ You care about clean git history
- ❌ Quick one-off tasks (just use Claude directly)
- ❌ Prototyping (basic vibecoding is fine)

**Time:** ~10 minutes


### Other GSD Commands

Once you finish the module, here are more commands to explore:

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/gsd:progress` | Where am I? What's next? |
| `/gsd:quick "task"` | Ad-hoc task with GSD guarantees |
| `/gsd:discuss-phase N` | Clarify preferences before planning |
| `/gsd:debug` | Systematic debugging with agents |
| `/gsd:map-codebase` | Add GSD to an existing project |
| `/gsd:pause-work` | Clean handoff between sessions |
| `/gsd:resume-work` | Pick up where you left off |
| `/gsd:help` | See all commands |


### By the End

You'll have:
- A working Expense Splitter app (Phase 1 - you can continue to Phases 2 and 3)
- GSD installed and configured
- Understanding of fresh subagent contexts and why they matter
- Experience with the full GSD workflow
- Clean git history with atomic commits
- The ability to use GSD on your own projects
